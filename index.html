										<h2>My Name Is Tim Meek</h2>

									<p>I am a programmer who was previously a pre-medical student. The semester leading up to my first medical school semester (Spring 2020) I found my love for programming and 
										changed my desired professional path. In this short amount of time I have acquired an abundance of knowledge for several programming languages and techniques. In my future 
										I hope to provide my knowledge, critical thinking and problem solving skills to help improve the experience and capabilities of technology that users rely on.</p>

									<h3>A Few Of My Projects</h3>
									<p>Within my short programming career, I have been able to produce and learn how to perform several interesting projects. Some of those include the following:</p>

												<h4>My 3D Printing Business</h4>
												<p>In the Summer of 2020 I got into 3D printing. Soon after learning the in's and out's of this hobby I learned I had a true talent for making beautiful
													and fascinating custom items for people. Using Fusion360 and other CAD softwares I have taught myself to make custom 3D models that I then slice (using slicer programs) to 3D print.  
													Using Marlin (an open source firmware based on FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) 3D-printers using the Arduino platform) I am often writing my own code in C++ to allow my 3D printers 
													to be more efficient and capable. Ontop of just 3D printing I also make things using a CNC machine, as well as laser engraver that all run on similar software.
													I am overjoyed that I have been able to turn this fascination into a side business while still attending school. (Website currently down while finalizing business information)</p>

										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image "><img src="images\AddressBookPic.png" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Address Book Java Application</h4>
												<p>Built an application in java that runs off of an "Address Book" database. Database connections were made through Java to allow the user to insert, update, 
													delete, and search for users personal information within the "Address Book" using a GUI. (Still in development)</p>

										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images\AdventureGamePic.png" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Zork Style Python Game</h4>
												<p>Using Python I wrote a text-based adventure game that will allow the user to navigate through a multi-level house and use command like "move certain_direction" and "look" to get information about where they are currently
													located. The user also contains an inventory of items that can be gathered and used within the house by using "get item_name", "drop item_name" and "use item_name".</p>

										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image "><img src="images\FileEditPic.png" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>File Editor</h4>
												<p>Built a file editor that runs in Java terminal that allows the user to insert a text file and perform commands such as "A" to append, "D" to delete a certain line or multiple lines if a range of numbers are included,
													"I" to insert a line in a certain location, "L" to list the updated text file and "E" to commit the changes to the file.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Building and Programming My Own Arcade Machine</h4>
												<p>Using a Raspberry Pi, RetroPie (a collection of open source software for emulating retro games), EmulationStation (the UI for browsing and launching games), RetroArch (the actual emulation management), 
													and several emulators I was build a fully functioning arcade machine that is capable of running 1,000's of ROMs based on several different architectures that are fully playable based on the hardware I 
													chose to use. On top of building the cabinet from scratch I designed the artwork used for the cabinet inspired by a sticker bomb theme.</p>
